## Course description

Students are often well trained in the details of specific models relevant to their respective fields. This course presents a generic definition of a model in the social sciences as well as a taxonomy of the wide range of different types of models used. We then cover principles of model building, including static versus dynamic models, linear versus nonlinear, simple versus complicated, and identification versus overfitting. Major types of models implemented in this course include linear and nonlinear regression, machine learning (e.g., parametric, Bayesian and nonparametric), agent-based and structural models. We will also explore the wide range of computational strategies used to estimate models from data and make statistical and causal inference. Students will study both good examples and bad examples of modeling and estimation and will have the opportunity to build their own model in their field of interest.

## Required textbooks

* [James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2013). *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*. New York: Springer.](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7)
    * Great coverage of machine learning topics such as linear regression, classification, resampling methods, decision trees/random forests, support vector machines, and unsupervised learning methods
* [King, G. (1998). *Unifying Political Methodology: The Likelihood Theory of Statistical Inference*. University of Michigan Press.](http://proxy.uchicago.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=e000xna&AN=317921&site=ehost-live&scope=site)
    * Solid introduction to likelihood theory for conducting inference
    * Thorough explanation of maximum likelihood explanation
    * Includes applications for continuous and discrete variable regression models, time series, and multiple equation models (though admittedly I haven't use it for time series or multiple equations)
